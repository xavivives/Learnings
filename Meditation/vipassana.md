# Vipassana

Vipassana is a meditation technique that helps purify the mind through accepting reality as it is.

When you start practicing it, you are considered to be in the path of Dhamma, the path of liberation / enlightment/ purification.

## Notes 
- The technique is done by **observing** all the flow of **sensations** that we constantly have throughout our bodies.

- The point is to dissacociate ourselves from those sensations, no matter how gross or subtle they feel, or how good or bad ( which are associations already). 

- You learn to not react to those sensations and to simply observe it **equanimously** (with the understanding of the law of nature, the law of impermanence)

- Eventually, through consistent practice, you go deeper into your subconscious mind, which is said to be connected to our sensations experienced in our bodies. 

- By going deep into your subconciousness, you are able to find the root of the problems, the sufferings, the suppressed emotions that were never processed correctly, and then you will be able to observe it (with equanimity) and release yourself from it. 

- It is not to enter a religion, though many different religious people practice it

- It is not sactarian. In fact, it's **universal**. 
Ie. The technique does not teach you to follow any specific god or belief, it releases you from it.

- Discovered by the famous Buddha, or more precisely, by Gautama the Buddha. Yet, you don't need to be a buddhist nor a monk or a nun to practice Vipassana and benefit from it.

- The main goal is help you live in peace and harmony within yourself, unreliable of the exterior, which is out of our own control.
