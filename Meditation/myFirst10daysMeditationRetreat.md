# My first 10 days meditation retreat
From the 9th until 20th of January 2019 I was at a Vipassana meditation center called Dhamma Neru, in a village close to Barcelona. 

## Basic explanation of the course
The 10-day residential course, during which the students are able to learn and practice the basics of the technique of Vipassana Meditation (using discourses from S.N.Goenka).
Nothing is ever charged from the students.

Food, accomodation and all the basic needs are given; all in which is organised and served by volunteers, often old students from previous courses.

All Vipassana centers are run by donations given by anyone who had participated, for the sake of anyone else in this world, so they also could benefit from it. 

Noble silence is expected throughout the 10 days, except with the teachers, who helped clearify the student's doubts and questions.

## My experience there 

Previous to the retreat, I new very little about the technique and meditation in general, I never had a deep understanding of it's true benefits, only at the surface level. 
Neither am I religious nor have a clue about it, but it did not matter as the technique of Vipassana had very little to do with any kind of religion. 

I tried to not create any expectaitons.
