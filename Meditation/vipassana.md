# Vipassana

Vipassana is a meditation technique that helps purify the mind through **accepting reality as it is**.

When you start practicing it, you are considered to be in the **path of Dhamma**, the path of liberation / enlightenment/ purification.

## Notes 
- The technique is done by **observing** all the flow of **sensations** that we constantly have throughout our bodies.

- The point is to **disassociate** ourselves from those sensations, no matter how gross or subtle they feel, or how good or bad ( which are associations already). 

- You learn to **not react** to those sensations and to simply observe it **equanimously** (with the understanding of the law of nature, the **law of impermanence**).

- Eventually, through consistent practice, you go **deeper into your subconscious mind**, which is said to be connected to our sensations experienced in our bodies. 

- By going deep into your subconscious, you are able to find the root of the problems, the sufferings, the **suppressed emotions** that were never processed correctly, and then you will be able to observe it (with equanimity) and release yourself from it. 

- It is not to enter or follow a religion, though many different religious people practice it.

- It is not sectarian. In fact, it's **universal**. 
IE. The technique does not teach you to follow any specific god or belief, it releases you from it.

- Discovered by the famous Buddha, or more precisely, by **Gautama** the Buddha. Yet, you don't need to be a Buddhist nor a monk or a nun to practice Vipassana and benefit from it.

- The main goal is to help you live in peace and harmony within yourself, independently of the exterior, which is out of our own control.
