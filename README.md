All the knowledge I'm interested in will be found here.

## CONTEXT

I had started this repository thanks to the massive inspiration of a man called [Nikita Voloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev), documenting and sharing almost everything he knows.

I find it such a clever and efficient way to learn new things, and possibly easing out the job for others.

I consider myself a pretty ignorant person in many things, but one thing I do value about myself is that I do not like to settle, I need to constantly improve and learn; which has become the purpose of my life, other than loving and being loved.

I see so many benefits to using github for this purpose, my brain is so limited and not designed to keep so much memory...

I am also constantly searching for new and better tools to make my life more efficient so any recommendations is highly appreciated.

## TOOLS I AM CURRENTLY USING TO GET THINGS DONE:

### FOR MANAGEMENT 
- Todoist
- Airtable (for management of finance, diet, goals in life, specific projects, my teaching job...)
- Github
- Google Document (for my random thoughts, ideas, quick sketches...)

### FOR DESIGN
- Pinterest
- Dribble
- Sketchr (design tool for tablets)
- Google Drive or Dropbox (to save and share files efficiently)
- Adobe Photoshop
- Vectr (online free vector platform)
- Pixr (like a simplified photoshop but online and for free )

### FOR TUTORING
- Google Drive or Dropbox (to save and share files efficiently)
- Google Document (everything I teach to each student is saved in a Google Doc)
- Airtable (I made a video showing briefly how I use this tool for the purpose of managing my job as a teacher )
